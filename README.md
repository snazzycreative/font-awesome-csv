# Font Awesome CSV
I needed a list of the icons so I took to Google to see if it existed. I found other people asking for the same thing but didn't find a recent version. I figured I'd share. 

I achieved this result by copying the contents of the front end cheat sheet into Sublime Text and using the find all command to position my cursor in multiple places at once to remove the code value and glpyh character.  

## License

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

The list of icon names also belong to Font Awesome. I'm in no way affiliated with the team.
